This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to assist farmers and agricultural practitioners in making data-driven decisions regarding crop selection and fertilizer application.
The system analyzes various environmental and soil parameters, such as soil type, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and nutrient levels, to provide tailored recommendations.
Crop Recommendation:
The system suggests the most suitable crops for a specific location or soil condition by analyzing historical agricultural data and real-time environmental factors. 
This helps maximize yield and ensures optimal use of resources
Fertilizer Recommendation:
Based on the nutrient deficiencies identified in the soil and the selected crop, the system recommends appropriate fertilizers (organic or chemical) in specific quantities to improve soil fertility and boost crop production.
